#CS480 Term Project

####Winter 2014 @ OSU

####Authors: Ryan & Greg

This term we wrote a compiler/translator from IBTL to Gforth in Python.

See the readmes in each directory to get an overview of each component.

Each milestone built on the previous ones so hw5/milestone5 includes all of the steps for the compiler: scanner.py -> parser.py -> generator.py. And the process is initiated and managed by compiler.py.
